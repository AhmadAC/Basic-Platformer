editor_handlers_dialog.py:
To add event handling logic for the new "asset_properties_editor" dialog, including its internal dropdown for selecting asset types and interacting with variable input fields.
editor_handlers_map_editing.py:
To import and use the editor_history module for push_undo_state, undo, and redo calls.
To implement the right-click-and-drag functionality for multi-object deletion.
To handle clicks on the new asset palette options dropdown menu and trigger the opening of the Asset Properties Editor dialog.
editor_handlers_menu.py:
To ensure that when new maps are created or loaded, the undo/redo history in editor_state (via editor_history) is appropriately reset or initialized. (This is largely handled by editor_state.reset_map_context() which now clears undo/redo stacks).
editor_map_utils.py:
To modify save_map_to_json and load_map_from_json to correctly save and load the asset_specific_variables (the custom properties for assets).
To update export_map_to_game_python_script to include these asset_specific_variables in the exported game level file, so the game can use these custom parameters.
editor_ui.py:
This file will require significant additions:
A new function start_asset_properties_dialog() to initialize and show the new dialog.
Updates to draw_active_dialog() to call a new internal drawing function for the "asset_properties_editor".
New internal drawing functions within editor_ui.py to render the contents of the Asset Properties Editor dialog (e.g., the dropdown for asset selection, labels for variables, input fields/widgets for editing variable values, and its own scrollbar if needed).
