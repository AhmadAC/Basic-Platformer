Change color of drawn sprites in editor. 
Completely disable fireball when crouching. 
Sending new maps to others. 
Add sound files. 
Check roll frames, timing, and try to fix it. 
Add a mushroom that makes the user big for 30 seconds and put a transformation time remaining bar under the health bar. Attacks are twice as strong 
Throw objects. 
Disable fireball and add it as an ability players acquire.
