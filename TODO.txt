Current Platformer game issues, things to test, and features to add:

Check LAN. 
Logging is not working well. 
Change color of drawn sprites in editor. 
Completely disable fireball when crouching. 
Sending new maps to others. 
Add sound files. 
Check roll frames, timing, and try to fix it. 
Add a mushroom that makes the user big for 30 seconds and put a transformation time remaining bar under the health bar. Attacks are twice as strong 
Throw objects. 
Disable fireball and add it as an ability players acquire. 
Add some settings to editor maps such as modifying base stats, attacks, if fireball is enable or disabled. This temporarily overwrites the constants. 
Add a new drawable sprite - fences. 
Add switch controller support. 
Add the option for only one player or more.
Up to 3 players? 
Make a next level sprite (black hole) 
Make a destructible bridge? 
Make wall switches. 
Make remote C4. 
Make a small circular drone that will die in one hit but can navigate (player movement is disabled) and turn switches on.
